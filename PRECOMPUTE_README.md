# Precomputing SAM Masks for Visible Images

This README explains how to precompute Segment Anything Model (SAM) masks for **visible images only** to significantly speed up training time for the TH-Fuse-SAM model.

## Why Precompute Masks?

SAM is a powerful segmentation model, but it's computationally expensive to run during training. By precomputing the masks for visible images in your dataset, you can:

1. Reduce training time by 50-70%
2. Lower GPU memory requirements
3. Maintain the same quality of results

The IR (infrared) masks are still computed on-the-fly during training, as they're often simpler and faster to process.

## Prerequisites

- SAM model checkpoint (e.g., `sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth`)
- Your training dataset with IR and VI images

## Step 1: Precompute the Masks for Visible Images

Use the `precompute_masks.py` script to generate masks for all visible images in your dataset:

```bash
python precompute_masks.py \
  --sam_checkpoint "sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth" \
  --sam_model_type "vit_h" \
  --dataset_path "dataset/train" \
  --output_dir "precomputed_masks"
```

This will:
1. Load each visible image from your dataset
2. Run SAM to generate masks for visible images only
3. Save the masks as .npy files in the output directory

The process might take a while but is much faster than precomputing masks for both modalities.

## Step 2: Train with Precomputed Masks

Once you have precomputed the visible masks, you can use them during training:

```bash
python train.py \
  --use_sam \
  --sam_checkpoint "sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth" \
  --sam_model_type "vit_h" \
  --precomputed_masks_dir "precomputed_masks" \
  --dataset_path "dataset/train" \
  --epochs 100
```

The training will use the precomputed masks for visible images, while still computing IR masks on-the-fly.

## Step 3: Test with Precomputed Masks

Similarly, you can use precomputed masks during testing:

```bash
python test.py \
  --model_path "models/model_epoch100.pth" \
  --use_sam \
  --sam_checkpoint "sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth" \
  --sam_model_type "vit_h" \
  --precomputed_masks_dir "precomputed_masks" \
  --ir_dir "test_imgs/ir" \
  --vi_dir "test_imgs/vi" \
  --output_dir "results"
```

## Notes and Troubleshooting

### Mask Structure

The precomputed masks are saved in the following structure:
```
precomputed_masks/
  └── vi/
      ├── image1.npy
      ├── image2.npy
      └── ...
```

Note that only visible image masks are precomputed; IR masks are computed during training.

### Memory Requirements

The precomputed masks can take up disk space, but much less than if you were storing both IR and visible masks. Make sure you have enough storage available.

### Fallback Mechanism

If a precomputed mask is not found for a specific visible image, the system will fallback to generating it on-the-fly. This ensures training continues even if some masks are missing.

### Windows-Specific Notes

For Windows users:
1. Make sure to use appropriate path separators in your commands (`\\` or `/`)
2. If you encounter CUDA out-of-memory errors, try reducing the batch size

## Performance Comparison

Using precomputed visible masks typically provides the following improvements:
- Training speed: 2-3x faster
- GPU memory usage: 20-30% less
- Results quality: Identical to on-the-fly computation
